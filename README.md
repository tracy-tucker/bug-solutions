# BugSolutions

Welcome to BugSolutions!

This is a Sinatra Portfolio project for the purpose of creating a CRUD, MVC app using Sinatra.

The app's intended use it to help Pest Management Professionals track insecticide products they use to control specific insects.

In order to use this application, the user must either login or signup for an account.

Once the user is logged in, the user will be able to see a list of all products that have been created in the application, as well as access to create new products to be stored in the application database. The user will also have access to view a list of bugs that are associated with each product.

If the product was NOT created by the user, the user will have view access only.

If the product was created by the user, the user will have access to edit and delete each of their own products.

Bugs cannot be deleted as an independent entity, rather bugs can be edited or deleted based on the product association within product edits.
